Easily move Payday 2 saves from a different Steam or Epic account to a Steam account.  
I have not yet tested if this is going to mark you as a cheater or not so use it at your own risk.


## Instructions
The Epic Games saves folder is usually in %localappdata%\PAYDAY 2\saves and is the folder with the longest id.  
The Steam Cloud saves folder is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\\<userid>\218620\remote. Replace <userid> with your.

1. Remove all files within the Steam Cloud saves folder.
2. Take all files inside the Epic Games saves folder (probably called save000.sav and save098.sav) and move them to the Steam Cloud saves folder.
3. Start the game and verify that you now get the error: "Save data belongs to a different user fix".
4. Close the game.
5. Install SuperBLT.
6. Download the [main branch of this repo](https://github.com/NAHFE/PD2-save-mover/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
7. Put the folder from the ZIP file in the mods folder in the game directory.
8. Start the game and verify that the error is now gone.
9. Start any heist (preferably a tutorial heist) and do at least the first day. This makes the game triggers a save so that your new steam id is saved.
10. Close the game and remove the mod.
11. Now you should be able to play normally.
